## Question 1

@title Identifying a Point on a Line Graph  
@description This question assesses understanding of coordinate geometry and interpreting points on a line graph.  

@question The line shown in the coordinate plane passes through the points $(0, 2)$ and $(4, 10)$. Which point lies on the line?

@option (2, 5)  
@option (3, 7)  
@@option (2, 6)  
@option (1, 4)  

@explanation The slope of the line is $(10-2)/(4-0) = 2$. Equation: $y = 2x + 2$. Substituting $x=2$ â†’ $y=6$. So $(2,6)$ lies on the line.

## Question 2

@title Solving Quadratic Equations  
@description This question tests the ability to solve quadratic equations by factoring.  

@question Solve for $x$:  
$$x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$$  

@instruction Choose the correct values of $x$.  
@difficulty easy  
@Order 2  

@option $x=2$ or $x=3$  
@@option $x=3$ or $x=4$  
@option $x=4$ or $x=5$  
@option $x=6$ or $x=2$  

@explanation Factorize: $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = (x-3)(x-4) = 0$. So, $x=3$ or $x=4$.
